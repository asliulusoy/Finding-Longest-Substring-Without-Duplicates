# Finding-Longest-Substring-Without-Duplicates

>Finding the longest substring in a script that does not have any duplicate characters in it

This is a python script that reads a string from the command line and finds out the longest substring in it that doesn't contain any duplicate characters.

## Examples
```
$ python3 solution.py
input: ABBCDDEFGHII
The length of the longest non-repeating character substring is 6, and the substring is: DEFGHI

$ python3 solution.py
input: AABBCCD
The length of the longest non-repeating character substring is 2, and the substring is: CD

$ python3 solution.py
input: ABCD
The length of the longest non-repeating character substring is 4, and the substring is: ABCD
```
